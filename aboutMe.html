        <h1> My Resume </h1>

        <div>
        <h2>Opening statement</h2>
        <p>My name is Tayyiba Hussain. I am currently a sophomore attending Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine, 
        hoping to pursue a career in STEM. My long-term goal has always been to have a positive impact on the lives of the public. 
        It has been a vision of mine since childhood. I am determined to help and educate others in ways that would guide them towards 
        being better. I aim to use my knowledge to aid those in vulnerable populations, the less fortunate, and those who may simply yearn
        for a source of securement. </p>
